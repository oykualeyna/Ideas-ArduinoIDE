# Ideas-ArduinoIDE
Board: Arduino Uno Rev3.

Type of Motor: Servo Motor.

Sensor Type: Touch Sensor.

RGB LED: Common Cathode RGB LED.

Software IDE: Arduino IDE 

Programming Language: Arduino Programming Language.

Application Purpose:The aim of this project is to design and implement an interactive and engaging game called "IDEAS," where players use touch sensors to level up by matching emojis with their corresponding colors. The game seeks to improve players' reflexes and enhance their attention to detail through three different levels of increasing speed and difficulty.

Each color represents a specific "idea," while each emoji has a unique "idea" connection. Players receive feedback via an LED and buzzer when they touch the sensor with the correct color. The game aims to develop players' cognitive skills, quick decision-making abilities, and focus by requiring them to touch the sensor at the right time based on the colors randomly generated by RGB LEDs associated with the emojis.

A servo motor, controlled by a potentiometer, interacts with players by displaying "GAMER1," "GAMER2," or "GAMER3" on an LCD screen based on the potentiometer's value. The servo motor rotates according to the selected gamer, and the game provides real-time feedback through LED and buzzer alerts, as well as RGB LEDs and random colors, for correct and incorrect matches. The potentiometer also allows players to select the number of participants (up to three), adding a customizable element to the game.

In conclusion, the game was developed using components such as RGB LEDs, touch sensors, a servo motor, an LED, buttons, and a buzzer on the Arduino Uno Rev3 board. By integrating these components, the game offers an educational and entertaining experience for players.
